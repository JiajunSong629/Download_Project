## High level overview

### [Sensor-based, single-user activity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_recognition#Sensor-based,_single-user_activity_recognition)

*Levels of sensor-based activity recognition*

- At the lowest level where the sensor data are collected, statistical learning concerns how to find the detailed locations of agents from the received signal data.
- At an intermediate level, statistical inference may be concerned about how to recognize individuals' activities
from the inferred location sequences and environmental conditions at the lower levels.
- at the highest level a major concern is to find out the overall goal or subgoals of an agent from the activity sequences
through a mixture of logical and statistical reasoning.
